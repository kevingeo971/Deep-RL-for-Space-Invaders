# Deep-RL-for-Space-Invaders

This project uses Reinforcement Learning to play Space Invaders an atari game. 

The implementation uses :
- Convolutional Neural Networks (Pytorch)
- Model Replacement
- Experience replay 
- Stacked frames
- Epsilon greedy 

It is trained on Google Colab using a GPU. This implementation can get a score of upto 725.
